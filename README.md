# Bookstore

This was a class project that uses servlets and a database to present a bookstore inventory and handle a cart and sales. It no longer works because the database was removed at the end of the semester but I am working on making a local version or hosting the data elsewhere.

However, it is still a good example of model-view-controller architecture, specifically the DAO pattern, and JSP. The classes are located in [java](src/main/java) and the JSP, CSS, etc. in [webapp](/src/main/webapp).
